# Wake on LAN Container

Containerized server and UI for Wake on LAN.

## Description
Wake on LAN is not possible over most VPN connections. One way to work around this limitation is to run a helper service on the local area network that sends the magic packet on your behalf.

This project seeks to provide the minimal container necessary to enable wake on LAN via a VPN connection.
